Web apis deliver client requests and return responses via Json or XML usually over the internet each request and response cycle is an API call. If weather com creates an API through which anybody can access their data but only in the ways that weather com allows then Apple could just use that API to populate their weather app so how do apis actually work let's use the example of web apis which are the type of apis that deliver client Requests and Returns.
